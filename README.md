# 🧠 OneReview: The AI-Powered Decentralized Trust Protocol

## 🌍 Overview

**OneReview** is a decentralized, AI-driven reputation platform built on the **One Chain Network**.  
It’s designed to restore **trust, transparency, and authenticity** in the online review ecosystem.

Today’s reviews are broken — filled with fake, low-effort, or bot-generated content that misleads consumers and hurts honest businesses.  
OneReview fixes this by combining **AI verification**, **blockchain transparency**, and a **Review-to-Earn** incentive model.
